                        The Colorado Tree Coalition (CTC) is a non-profit organization
                        whose mission is to lead statewide efforts to preserve, renew
                        and enhance community forests.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        The CTC would like to thank Neal Bamesberger for managing the champion/notable tree list over the years.
                        Without his diligence and enthusiasm this app would never be possible!!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regis University and the Denver Botanic Gardens have dozens of champion/notable trees that do not have specific GPS coordinates for this app yet.
                        Please visit these sites to view all the great and rare trees. Both facilities have maps onsite of their specific champion trees.
                    </p>
